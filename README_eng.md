# Project: Hungry people [Пожалуйста, нажмите для переключения на русский язык](./README.md)

This is one of the first HTML/CSS projects created at the very beginning of my activity as a frontend developer. Some later it was decided to redo this project as a small application developed with JavaScript in combination with React.js library to support new skills got during my classes at [Yandex.Praktikum school](https://practicum.yandex.ru).

The application is being developed at the moment as well as has been used for using newly got skills.

Todo list for the furher reworking is: to improve adaptive layout, to refactor this using React routing, to complete the photo gallery page.

The responsive interface of this page had not been described at the Figma layout so I created this by myself.

[The initial Figma layout may be found via this link](https://www.figma.com/file/99VWS9wLtcNpWYAvWWbNwo/Hunger---Website-Template?node-id=0%3A1)

The page can be seen by the following [link](https://nikolaykrishtopa.github.io/hunger)

Many thanks for your attention!
